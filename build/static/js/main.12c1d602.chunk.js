I only dared to crack a few inches at first, as if you could see, and would consider it an invasion of privacy. By the end of the night I would open them as wide as they would go as the songs spilled out and mingled with the rustling of the leaves and sounded to me an inconceivable kind of serene.","The first week you hadn\u2019t yet settled in, or else I hadn\u2019t noticed. The second week I heard it on a Tuesday evening, just a strand of a tune carried through the breeze on a cold night that reminded me to shut the window. That Thursday I heard it fully: through some luck of sonic reflection or else divine intervention, loud and clear a song on the wind that I knew was from you, \u201cI dream a highway back to you, love/A winding ribbon with a band of gold\u201d. Three weeks into an isolation I hadn\u2019t prepared for it stopped me in my tracks. I sat down and listened all night. One song after another, some poignant, some irreverent, each like a conversation with an old friend that brought me back to life.","By the second week our schedules had settled. Some time around 8:15 (occasionally on the hour, never later than 23 minutes past) when the night was about to take hold, but a faint light still played across the uppermost leaves, you would open your windows. On still nights when I listened closely I swear I could hear the faint sound of a needle dropping. And we\u2019d sit, together, separated by a ceiling that was a floor and a lack of chance encounters.","I began to wonder, did you know I was there with you? I could hear your feet pad across the floor, but did I give any indication back? Were you sitting in a big comfy chair, sipping a glass of wine or a bourbon with ice clinking, or maybe carefully straining tea into your favorite mug. Did you have to get up to adjust the volume, to flip the record? Or were you cozied up next to the player, underneath a blanket you wouldn\u2019t dare disturb? Did you know you were throwing me a lifeline, or was it just something to do? Music in the evening, wind blowing, no care to who hears. I tried poking the ceiling with the handle of a mop to prove I was alive, but you only turned down the volume and I spent a miserable 24 hours worried to the bone that I\u2019d scared you away as the faint song echoed, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll go home/Try to be sane, try to pretend/None of it happened/Destined to be, lonely old me\u201d.","On the fifth week I began talking to my cat. Not in the cutesy way with cheeky voices like they\u2019re a cross between a lovably infirm grandparent and a caterwauling cartoon, but long, drawn out discussions about who I was, what I wanted, where I was going with my life. He usually didn\u2019t answer, but when he did he was insightful and witty, so I knew I was deranged. That night you seemed to sense my desperation and matched it with surging anthems; \u201cDespite all my rage, I\u2019m still just a rat in a cage\u201d blared out and was so on the nose but so perfectly timed that I was only vaguely alarmed when Hypen (that\u2019s the cat) glared at me with murder. \u201cAlive in the superunknown, first it steals your mind and then it steals your soul\u201d, only something so soaring and vague could feel so cathartic. I slept soundly that night and nothing untoward talked back to me again.","The next week I swear you were calling out to me. \u201cYou know that old trees just grow stronger/And old rivers grow wilder every day\u201d, and I knew you felt the strain I was feeling. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 bout you/Do you think about me still/Or do you not think so far ahead?\u201d, and I knew you felt me there with you. \u201cIf we were vampires and death was a joke/We\u2019d go out on the sidewalk and smoke/And laugh at all the lovers and their plans/I wouldn\u2019t feel the need to hold your hand\u201d, and I knew you were waiting for me like I waited for you.","That night I dreamed a vivid dream of a sun pouring down light in buckets so great that it piled up in the gutters and overflowed into the street and strained the windows and whisked me out of bed and when I stepped outside it swallowed me whole and I felt a joyful feeling I couldn\u2019t name.","On the first day of what we agreed to call normal it rained. It rained like the clouds had a debt to pay. The water sloughed off the roof in great waves and the dip in the street where we never parked filled with the downpour. I opened my window and waited, but the music never came. Instead a flurry of rustling, the stomp of boots, a frenzy down the stairs. I rushed outside and saw you on the sidewalk, turned away. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I opened my mouth, and a tremulous tune from a song I knew and you knew came out. You turned around, and I saw you standing there."]},{"id":1,"title":"THE SMIRK","text":["A pallor struck the parlor room as the walls dripped red in something almost but not quite seeming like blood and my heart tried to leap and sink simultaneously but only managed to bubble up a sudden gasp. I\u2019ll explain why, but let\u2019s begin at the beginning if it\u2019s not too late.","I could get over just about anything else, but not the smell. We had been confined to our home for weeks, and at first I thought it might be my imagination, but now there was no more denying it. He had acquired a smell about him, being confined to a single home. A house cat he is not, but one should be able to take care of one\u2019s own self. Some things are just basic manners. He had completely given up on the most basic of chores. Dishes sat, the remnants of a past meal putrefying in the sink as a growing monument to our tension. Sometimes I\u2019d call his name and he\u2019d refuse to answer. Just sat and stared, somehow without blinking. Other times I\u2019d swear I could hear him call my name, but when I\u2019d enter the room he\u2019d stay quiet with his mouth seemingly permanently fixed into a barely perceptible smirk.","It\u2019s the smirk I couldn\u2019t stand. Callously floating, his face empty but his lips curved ever just so. No matter how hard I tried I couldn\u2019t shake it off. I would see it in dreams, the image came to me while working, while doing dishes (someone had to), while taking out the trash, while trying to think of anything but.","So I did. Think of anything else that is. The next morning I took my coffee black in a bright pink mug, it used to make him laugh and I chuckled as I brought it into the parlor room. That\u2019s what we called the space with a tv and a couch, we thought it was hilarious, like we were sophisticated socialites instead of people who watched one more episode than we intended every night. I cozied up in the big comfy chair and almost enjoyed myself, until I looked up and saw him. His mouth smirking back at me. Relentlessly. Somehow even more pronounced than before. The smirk was a twist of a smile but it was a pounding in my head, unceasingly reminding me, if he would just speak! If he would only say a single thing. Apologize. Tell a joke. Forgive me. But it was too late for that. I walked into the kitchen and grabbed his arm and carried it back and trembled, at first from the realization of what I had done, then from the tremendous bang just outside the window.","The house shook. Glasses shattered against the walls and the floors. A pallor struck the parlor room as the walls dripped red and my insides twisted in horror as my brain squirmed to escape and my mouth fell open. I dropped the jar I held and out poured the preserving liquid and a third of your left arm. Behind me in the kitchen I could hear the floors rattle as the cutlery and the plates and the jars containing your left shin, right kidney, and eight of your 10 toes descended and shattered and left a paste of blood and preservatives.","There, in front of me, the contents of two thirds of yourself and all of my fears were smeared against the floor amongst shattered mason jars. Instinctively I clambered atop the chair to avoid the glass and from that perch I could see: a medley of body parts and blood and formaldehyde strewn about. The chair tottered under my uneasy climbing and I fell face first to the floor and a daggering slice of a broken jar. And just before I hit I could see it in full, a ghastly painting in the shape of a smirk.","Outside two electricians puzzled over a transformer explosion and caught a whiff of a strange smell from a nearby home."]},{"id":2,"title":"THE TALLEST TREE IN THE WORLD","text":["Not every tree can be climbed. This is a thing my parents told me but I didn\u2019t see how it could be true. Every tree\u2019s got branches and every trunk has got to go to somewhere, so maybe we just weren\u2019t trying hard enough.","When I was 8 I was sure the tree in the courtyard was the tallest tree in the world. My mom told me about a tree with red wood that she said was taller than our building but all she showed were pictures and I don\u2019t see how a picture can prove anything you don\u2019t already know. Besides, our house is on the 4th floor, and our tree reaches at least to the old man\u2019s apartment on the 6th. I knocked on his door to ask if I could see the top of the tree from his balcony but he only opened the door a crack and I got told not to knock on strangers\' doors with weird requests. But there\u2019s just no way a tree could go higher than an elevator.","Every day this year on the way to school I would get a running start and jump up the tree to see if today was the day I would get any closer.  The lowest branch was too high for me, but I was told I get a little bit taller every day so I make sure to check every chance I get.","But that was before. Three weeks ago a man came on TV and told us to stay home. Another man kept saying \u201cChina\u201d and that made me want to dig a hole but I don\u2019t have a shovel and that seemed even harder than the tree.","So every day for three weeks I looked at that tree. On sunny days I could see dots of light run across the carpet as the leaves waved. On windy days I could reach out and touch the smaller branches, and when it rained and I opened the windows I could feel the rain drops drip from the highest branches and hear my mom yelling to shut the darn window and stop getting the carpet soaked. ","Yesterday I figured it out. This whole time I was looking at it wrong. Maybe not every tree can be climbed from the bottom, but if you get a headstart you can still make it to the top. The closest branch wasn\u2019t the biggest, but neither am I. If I wore my best shoes, and I jumped as far as I could, and I didn\u2019t think about the ground, I could make it. ","So today I woke up and I felt different. I felt like someone who could climb the tallest tree in the world, so I did. And that\u2019s how I got here. And it\u2019s more amazing than I could have imagined. I can see and hear and feel things I never could from the house. I can see that old man\u2019s cat on the 6th floor, and I can see the birds waving hello, and I can see the big red truck in the courtyard, and I can hear people yelling, and I can hear the leaves\u2019 applause, but most of all I can feel the sun on my face, and I can feel the branch swaying just a bit in the breeze, and I can feel my hands grabbing the bark so tightly all my fingers are turning red, and I know that sound is the cherry picker coming to cherry pick me and I know I should be scared but I\u2019m not and I know I would have been scared for weeks but I wasn\u2019t and I know it\u2019s because I was focused, I was planning, I was dreaming, and I know that I\u2019m on top of the tallest tree in the world."]}]')},29:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(30)},30:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var n=a(9),o=a(10),i=a(11),r=a(12),s=a(0),d=a.n(s),h=a(8),l=a.n(h),u=(a(35),a(21)),c=a(27),m=a(28),w=a(17),g=function(e){Object(r.a)(a,e);var t=Object(i.a)(a);function a(){return Object(n.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(o.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){var e=this.props.selected.text.map((function(e,t){return d.a.createElement("p",{key:t},e)}));return d.a.createElement(c.a,null,e)}}]),a}(d.a.Component),y=function(e){Object(r.a)(a,e);var t=Object(i.a)(a);function a(){return Object(n.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(o.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return d.a.createElement(c.a,null,d.a.createElement("h3",null,"Stories of mild interest!
